      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s already a way to do this, but here goes. OR maybe this is an anti-pattern. Either way, this is me, asking the stupid question.
I ran into this a few hours ago:
Sys.unsetenv(&amp;#34;ENTREZ_KEY&amp;#34;) library(brranching) mynames &amp;lt;- c(&amp;#34;Poa annua&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Salix goodingii&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Helianthus annuus&amp;#34;) phylomatic_names(taxa = mynames, format=&amp;#39;rsubmit&amp;#39;) No ENTREZ API key provided Get one via taxize::use_entrez() See https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2017/11/02/new-api-keys-for-the-e-utilities/ No ENTREZ API key provided Get one via taxize::use_entrez() See https://ncbiinsights.</description>

      <title>limiting dependencies in R package development</title>

      <description>The longer you do anything, the more preferences you may develop for that thing. One of these things is making R packages.
One preference I&amp;rsquo;ve developed is in limiting package dependencies - or at least limiting to the least painful dependencies - in the packages I maintain. Ideally, if a base R solution can be done then do it that way. Everybody has base R packages if they are using R, so you can&amp;rsquo;t fail there, at least on package installation.</description>

      <title>Balancing user friendliness and code fragility</title>

      <description>I occasionally think about these various topics and ping back and forth between them, thinking I&amp;rsquo;ve got to make a package more user friendly, then back to thinking oh, I really should make this package easier to maintain, but what if that makes it less user friendly?
I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to get these thoughts written down for a while now, so here goes.
User friendliness and code fragility It&amp;rsquo;s an unassailable good to make your code more user friendly.</description>

      <description>In rOpenSci - as in presumably most open source projects - we want the entire project to be sustainable, but also each individual software project to be sustainable.
A big part of each software project (aka R package in this case) being sustainable is the people making it, particularly whether:
how many contributors a project has, and how contributions are spread across contibutors There are discussions going on about how to increase contributors to any given project.</description>

      <title>Metrics for open source projects</title>

      <description>Measuring use of open source software isn&amp;rsquo;t always straightforward. The problem is especially acute for software targeted largely at academia, where usage is not measured just by software downloads, but also by citations.
Citations are a well-known pain point because the citation graph is privately held by iron doors (e.g., Scopus, Google Scholar). New ventures aim to open up citation data, but of course it&amp;rsquo;s an immense amount of work, and so does not come quickly.</description>

      <title>One R package for all your taxonomic needs</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2012/12/taxize/</link>

      <description>UPDATE: there were some errors in the tests for taxize, so the binaries aren&amp;rsquo;t avaiable yet. You can install from source though, see below.
Getting taxonomic information for the set of species you are studying can be a pain in the ass. You have to manually type, or paste in, your species one-by-one. Or, if you are lucky, there is a web service in which you can upload a list of species.</description>
