      <description>scrubr is an R library for cleaning species occurrence records. It&amp;rsquo;s general purpose, and has the following approach:
We think using a piping workflow (%&amp;gt;%) makes code easier to build up, and easier to understand. However, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to use pipes in this package. All inputs and outputs are data.frame&amp;rsquo;s - which makes the above point easier Records trimmed off due to various filters are retained as attributes, so can still be accessed for later inspection, but don&amp;rsquo;t get in the way of the data.</description>
