      <description>Why Butte County? I went to college at California State University, Chico - in Butte County, CA. I did a BA degree in Biology there. It was a great program as it was heavily focused on natural history - with classes on herps, birds, insects, fish, etc.
Specimen collections data Specimen collections data are increasingly being digitized, and often accessed via largeish platforms like GBIF and iDigBio. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll explore Butte County data found with iDigBio with the spocc R package.</description>

      <description>scrubr is an R library for cleaning species occurrence records. It&amp;rsquo;s general purpose, and has the following approach:
We think using a piping workflow (%&amp;gt;%) makes code easier to build up, and easier to understand. However, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to use pipes in this package. All inputs and outputs are data.frame&amp;rsquo;s - which makes the above point easier Records trimmed off due to various filters are retained as attributes, so can still be accessed for later inspection, but don&amp;rsquo;t get in the way of the data.</description>
