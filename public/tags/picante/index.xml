      <description>I gave a talk today on doing very basic phylogenetics in R, including getting sequence data, aligning sequence data, plotting trees, doing trait evolution stuff, etc.
Please comment if you have code for doing bayesian phylogenetic inference in R. I know phyloch has function mrbayes, but can&amp;rsquo;t get it to work&amp;hellip;

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged about this topic before, way back on 5 Jan this year.
Matt Helmus, a postdoc in the Wootton lab at the University of Chicago, published a paper with Anthony Ives in Ecological Monographs this year (abstract here). The paper addressed a new statistical approach to phylogenetic community structure.
As I said in the original post, part of the power of the PGLMM (phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models) approach is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to conduct quite so many separate statistical tests as with the previous null model/randomization approach.</description>

      <description>Anthony Ives, of University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Matthew Helmus of the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, present a new statistical method for analyzing phylogenetic community structure in an early view paper in Ecological Monographs. See the abstract here.
Up to now, most phylogenetic community structure papers have calculated metrics and used randomization tests to determine if observed metrics are different from random. The approach of Ives and Helmus fits models to observed data, instead of calculating single metrics.</description>
