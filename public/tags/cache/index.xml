      <description>hoardr is a client for caching files and managing those files.
You can definitely achieve the same tasks without a separate pacakge, and there&amp;rsquo;s a number of packages for caching various objects in R already. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think there was a tool for that did everything I needed.
The use cases I typically need hoardr for are when dealing with large files, either text (e.g., csv) or binary (e.g., shp) files that would be nice to not make the user of packages I maintain download again if they already have the file.</description>
