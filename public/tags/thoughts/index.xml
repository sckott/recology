      <description>This post is only tangentially about open science. It is more directly about the process of peer review and how it might be improved. I am working on a follow-up post about how these points can be addressed in an open publishing environment.
A recent paper on the arXiv got me thinking about the sticking points in the publishing pipeline. As it stands, most scientists have a pretty good understanding of how peer reviewed publishing is supposed to work.</description>

      <description>Recology used to be hosted on Blogger, and my personal website was hosted on Wordpress. Neither platform was very satisfying. Blogger is very limited in their layouts, unless you use dynamic views, which suck because they don&amp;rsquo;t allow javascript snippets to render GitHub gists. Wordpress is just limited all around as you can&amp;rsquo;t put in hardly anythig excep text and some pictures. They both have their place, but not so much for content that requires syntax highlighting, references, etc.</description>
