      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since most of my education has taken place above the organism level, and since my current job concerns sub-organism processes, I want to get more familiar with those sub-organism things. So I&amp;rsquo;m reading and taking notes on my blog about the stuff I&amp;rsquo;m reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off is the PDF compiled by Franco Preparata from Brown University called &amp;ldquo;A Biology Primer for Computer Scientists&amp;rdquo; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs173/papers/bioprimer.pdf&#34;&gt;https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs173/papers/bioprimer.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;section 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;life is defined as being able to replicate, and that&amp;rsquo;s possible with DNA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-2-chemical-composition&#34;&gt;section 2 chemical composition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chemical makeup of life is largely composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;molecules have different binding strengths and therefore different energy levels to break them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;molecules are held together by many types of bonds, one of which is the covalent bond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an agent that aids a chemical reaction is a catalyst; a biological catalyst is an enzyme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an enzyme itself is a molecule; and enzyme has a specific shape that matches a specific reagent it will catalyze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building blocks of living organisms are biomolecules; basic ones are sugars, fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleotides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two important types of sugars are ribose and deoxyribose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;amino acids are particularly important, of which there are 20 types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;amino acids make up proteins; polysaccharides made of large carbohydrates;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-3-nucleic-acids&#34;&gt;section 3 nucleic acids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building blocks of nucleic acids are nucleotides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a nucleotide is made up of three components: a base B, a sugar S and a phosphoric acid P. there&amp;rsquo;s 8 different nucleotide types (G, A, C, and T in DNA, and G, A, C, U in RNA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the S sugar of each nucleotide is called ribose;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nucleotides polymerize as nucleic acids, either DNA or RNA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNA Is double stranded; RNA Is single stranded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in DNA the two strands orient opposite directions with 5&amp;rsquo; to 3&amp;rsquo; and the other strand going 3&amp;rsquo; to 5&#39;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in DNA, each strand has nucleic acids that bind to the complementary nucleic acid in the other strand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-4-fundamental-cell-processes&#34;&gt;section 4 fundamental cell processes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;three major processes occur in the cell: DNA &lt;strong&gt;replication&lt;/strong&gt;, DNA-RNA &lt;strong&gt;transcription&lt;/strong&gt; and RNA-protein &lt;strong&gt;translation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-5-dna-replication&#34;&gt;section 5 DNA replication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNA replication is the process by which a double-stranded DNA sequences produces two double-stranded sequences identical to the original one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replication always proceeds from the 5&amp;rsquo; end to the 3&amp;rsquo; end - therefore goes in opposite directions in each strand (leading strand is 5&amp;rsquo;-3&amp;rsquo;, lagging strand is 3&amp;rsquo;-5&#39;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNA polymerases facilitate the replication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the leading strand a string of about 200 bases indicates where to start&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the lagging strand each Okazaki fragment is initiated by an RNA string synthesized by a specific enzyme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-6-dna-rna-transcription&#34;&gt;section 6 DNA-RNA transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transcription only uses the so called &amp;ldquo;genomic&amp;rdquo; strand, the one that goes from 5&amp;rsquo; to 3&#39;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;machinery that does transcription is called RNA-polymerase. it separates two DNA strands along a short area and transcription occurs along the short exposed strand, and DNA strands rejoin as the process proceeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In DNA replication, DNA is replicated in its entirety, whereas transcription is selective both in space (only certain substrings of DNA are transcribed) and time (depending on environment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different types of RNA: mRNA (messenger; involved in RNA-protein translation), rRNA (ribosomal; participate in the structure of the ribosome), tRNA (transfer; assume a rigid 3d configuration acting as linkages between mRNA and protein chains), snRNA (small nuclear; excision of introns and splicing of exons)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-7-rna-protein-translation&#34;&gt;section 7 RNA-protein translation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aka Protein synthesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNA is segmented into triplets of nucleotides; each triplet == codon; each codon is individually translated into an amino acid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are 64 codons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are 20 amino acids (so each amino acid is encoded by more than 1 codon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;translation occurs in the ribosome. ribosome can be compared to a tape reader (an mRNA sequence) that also produces an output tape (a protein). tRNA is also required (and are specific to a codon/amino acid pair?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-8-protein-structure&#34;&gt;section 8 protein structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proteins are polymers (polypeptides)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;amino acids fully specify a protein, BUT it is its spatial arrangement that determines its function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how polypeptides fold is not fully understood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protein structure levels
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;primary: the linear sequence of amino acids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;secondary: local folding patterns such as alpha helices and beta sheets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tertiary: complete 3D shape of a single polypeptide chain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quaternary: arrangement of multiple polypeptide subunits within a protein complex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
