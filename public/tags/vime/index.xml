      <description>&lt;p&gt;FigShare - I very much like this idea of a place to put your data online that is NOT published. Dryad is a nice place for datastes linked with published papers, but there isn&amp;rsquo;t really a place for datasets that perhaps did not make the cut for a published paper, and if known to the scientific community, could potentially help resolve the &amp;ldquo;file-drawer&amp;rdquo; effect in meta-analyses. (wow, run on sentence)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
