      <description>Recology used to be hosted on Blogger, and my personal website was hosted on Wordpress. Neither platform was very satisfying. Blogger is very limited in their layouts, unless you use dynamic views, which suck because they don&amp;rsquo;t allow javascript snippets to render GitHub gists.
