      <description>Recently I spun up a box on a cloud hosting provider planning to make a tens of thousdands of queries to an Elasticsearch instance on the same box. I could have done this on my own machine, but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to take up compute resources.
I installed R and Elasticsearch on the box, then went about doing my thang.
A day later when things were still running, the hosting provider sent me a message that apparently my box had been serving up a DDoS attack.</description>
