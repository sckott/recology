      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I spun up a box on a cloud hosting provider planning to make a tens of thousdands of queries to an Elasticsearch instance on the same box. I could have done this on my own machine, but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to take up compute resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed R and Elasticsearch on the box, then went about doing my thang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day later when things were still running, the hosting provider sent me a message that apparently my box had been serving up a DDoS attack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I spun up a box on a cloud hosting provider planning to make a tens of thousdands of queries to an Elasticsearch instance on the same box. I could have done this on my own machine, but didn&rsquo;t want to take up compute resources.</p>
<p>I installed R and Elasticsearch on the box, then went about doing my thang.</p>
<p>A day later when things were still running, the hosting provider sent me a message that apparently my box had been serving up a DDoS attack.</p>
<p>This was incredibly surprising, as I don&rsquo;t even know how to do such a thing.</p>
<p>After some digging it seems that the culprit was likely Elasticsearch, as a number of tutorials/blog posts state that Elaticsearch is insecure by default, so if it&rsquo;s exposed on a public port, someone can hack in. I had only used Elasticsearch locally on my own machine, so I hadn&rsquo;t thought about security. Here&rsquo;s a few resources for security help:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-elasticsearch-on-an-ubuntu-vps">DigitalOcean tutorial no. 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/elasticsearch-fluentd-and-kibana-open-source-log-search-and-visualization">DigitalOcean tutorial no. 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://saskia-vola.com/install-secure-elasticsearch-1-x-digital-ocean/">Blog post on securing ES</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26006373/how-to-secure-a-digital-ocean-elasticsearch-cluster">SO answer on securing ES</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Trying to narrow down the various pieces of advice for securing Elasticsearch, here&rsquo;s a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>iptables</code> (or rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nftables">nftables</a>?) to firewall the box</li>
<li>Whitelist certain trusted IPs</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://github.com/Asquera/elasticsearch-http-basic"><code>elasticsearch-http-basic</code></a> plugin, adds basic username/pwd login</li>
<li>Remove public access: use <code>network.bind_host: localhost</code> and <code>script.disable_dynamic: true</code> in the <code>elasticsearch.yml</code> config file <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-elasticsearch-on-an-ubuntu-vps">from</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Elasticsearch provides a new feature for security that&rsquo;s built into Elasticsearch, <a href="https://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/shield/">Shield</a>, but I believe it&rsquo;s only available to enterprise customers. Boo.</p>
