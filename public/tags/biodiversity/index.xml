      <description>I maintain an R client for the GBIF API, at rgbif. Been working on it for a few years, and recently been thinking that there should be a nice low level client for Python as well. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see one searching Github, etc. so I started working on one recently: pygbif
It&amp;rsquo;s up on pypi.
There&amp;rsquo;s not much in pygbif yet - I wanted to get something up to start getting some users to more quickly make the library useful to people.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: In response to Jarrett&amp;rsquo;s query I laid out a separate use case in which you may want to query by higher taxonomic rankings than species. See below. In addition, added examples of querying by location in reply to comments by seminym.
We have been working on an R package to get GBIF data from R, with the stable version available through CRAN, and the development version available on GitHub at https://github.</description>
