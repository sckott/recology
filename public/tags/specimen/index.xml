      <description>Why Butte County? I went to college at California State University, Chico - in Butte County, CA. I did a BA degree in Biology there. It was a great program as it was heavily focused on natural history - with classes on herps, birds, insects, fish, etc.
Specimen collections data Specimen collections data are increasingly being digitized, and often accessed via largeish platforms like GBIF and iDigBio. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll explore Butte County data found with iDigBio with the spocc R package.</description>
