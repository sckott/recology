      <description>I am part of the rOpenSci development team (along with Carl Boettiger, Karthik Ram, and Nick Fabina).
Our website: http://ropensci.org/.
Code at Github: https://github.com/ropensci
We entered two of our R packages for integrating with PLoS Journals (rplos) and Mendeley (RMendeley) in the Mendeley-PLoS Binary Battle. Get them at GitHub (rplos; RMendeley). These two packages allow users (from R! of course) to search and retrieve data from PLoS journals (including their altmetrics data), and from Mendeley.</description>

      <description>I gave a talk today on doing very basic phylogenetics in R, including getting sequence data, aligning sequence data, plotting trees, doing trait evolution stuff, etc.
Please comment if you have code for doing bayesian phylogenetic inference in R. I know phyloch has function mrbayes, but can&amp;rsquo;t get it to work&amp;hellip;

      <title>Two new rOpenSci R packages are on CRAN</title>

      <description>Carl Boettiger, a graduate student at UC Davis, just got two packages on CRAN. One is treebase, which which handshakes with the Treebase API. The other is rfishbase, which connects with the Fishbase, although I believe just scrapes XML content as there is no API. See development on GitHub for treebase here, and for rfishbase here. Carl has some tutorials on treebase and rfishbase at his website here, and we have an official rOpenSci tutorial for treebase here.</description>
