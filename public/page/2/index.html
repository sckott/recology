    <p>notes to self for next job hunt (some of which may be generally useful):
don’t apply to general tech companies anymore for many reasons. heard back from very very few but that may be b/c I don’t know many people at general tech companies never been able to get through interviews; they’re presumably looking for computer science grads (not me) most of their missions are probably not stuff I’d be happy about at the end of the day. despite missions of doing xyz, it’s probably really about $$ don’t apply to pharma companies any more. there’s lots of good software jobs in that sector, but i’ve struck out 3 times, and so that’s a clear pattern my background/whatever isn’t something they want next time only apply where I have a connection that can refer me or dig around for a referral. it’s super easy to apply for jobs, especially if you don’t write a cover letter; however, the less time I spend surely the less likely I am to hear back make sure (and I’ll probably fail to do it again this time, ugh) to write down what questions I was asked, how I answered, and how to improve on that answer. then study and reference those questions and answers for the next interview its good to have multiple offers at the same time, but then deciding is harder - &amp; I don’t love to negotiating - so maybe don’t worry about multiple offers at the same time next time around I have relatively low expectations in any interview b/c I don’t do technical interviews well - I also try to seek out orgs that do not have crazy technical interview processes - eg., Roche had a whiteboard technical interview that I totally bombed, but was unsurprising in hindsight since the interviewer was an ex-Googler. I’m more of a thinker than a quick responder, making it hard to do well in very fast paced (for me) tech interviews. Though I know i have been a good software engineer where I’ve worked, so these fast paced tech interviews are probably selecting for a certain kind of brain function I guess? seek out orgs with interview processes that have take home assignments - or at least timed coding tests on something like hackerrank - instead of live whiteboard/zoom tech inteviews my last job Deck had a take home test Axiom DS has a take home test approach AdHoc uses a take home test approach Invitae had a hackerrank test, not a take home but better than live coding test cover letters? I still don’t know whether these are worth doing or not. the advice seems to be mixed. they sure take a lot of time, so I hope they’re not necessary for most hiring managers; given my bullet above about spending more time on fewer applications, I could find time for a cover letter on every application if ther’s not that many some data about this last job search:

First, I couldn’t simply get any string out of each Python script - they needed to be strings specficied by a specific function parameter, and match a regex (e.g., start with ‘abc’).

The API has a number of routes, but really people only use the badges.

    <p>It’s been interesting switching jobs with respect to programming languages. I used to write 95% R - now I write 95% Python.
I have been using Python for many years, but not seriously or getting paid either. I’ve learned alot in the first 6 months.
Some Python things learned:
Functions and methods I used to think functions and methods were the same thing. But during the last 6 months I learned that functions and methods are not the same. Well, they’re not that different. A function outside a class is just called a function while a function inside a class is called a method. They could be exactly the same and do the same thing, but one is outside a class and the other inside a class.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In February this year I wroute about how many parameters functions should have, looking at some other languages, with a detailed look at R. On a related topic …
As I work on many R packages that are API clients for various web services, I began wondering: What is the best way to deal with API routes that have a lot of parameters?
The general programming wisdom I’ve seen is that a function should have no more than 3-4 parameters (e.g., this long SO thread, or this one). So should one do anything different from a normal function when that function is connecting to a web API route with a lot of parameters? I’ve not found very much spilled ink on this exact topic, but I’ll discuss what I have found.

    <p> Update on 2021-02-09: I’ve archived 8 more packages. Post below updated
Code is often arranged in packages for any given language. Packages are often cataloged in a package registry of some kind: NPM for node, crates.io for Rust, etc. For R, that registry is either CRAN or Bioconductor (for the most part).
CRAN has the concept of an archived package. That is, the namespace for a package (foo) is still in the registry (and can not be used again), but the package is archived - no longer gets updated and checks I think are no longer performed.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>taxizedb arose from pain in using taxize when dealing with large amounts of data in a single request or doing a lot of requests of any data size. taxize works with remote data sources on the web, so there’s a number of issues that can slow the response down: internet speed, server response speed (was a response already cached or not; or do they even use caching), etc.
The idea with taxizedb was to allow users to do the same things as taxize allows, but much faster by accessing the entire database for a data source on their own computer. The previous versions of taxizedb used a variety of different databases (MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite), so the technical barrier to entry was pretty high. In the newest version just released, we’ve drastically simplified the database situation, among other things.
