    <p>cowsay is a command line program written in Perl. The original version had a final release in 2016 (that’s the version of many installed cowsay programs) and there’s a number of forks of that release in Perl. There are also many many versions of cowsay in other programming languages, like the one I maintain written in R, unimaginatively called cowsay.
I wrote about cowsay here back in 2014. I didn’t think this would ever be 300&#43; stars popular, but here we are. Given that people seem to actually use it - or at least star it - seems worth putting some more time into it.

One of the projects I’ve been working on lately that uses Quarto is the WILDS Contributor Guide (WILDS = Workflows Integrating Large Data and Software). This guide (a Quarto book) is mostly a guide for our own immediate team members, but aims to a) be a guide for any contributors to our open source software work, and b) demonstrate good open source software practices for the greater Fred Hutch community where we work.

For context, the package is an API client.
It made sense to break the work for any given exported function into the following components, as applicable depending on the endpoint being handled (some endpoints needed just a few lines of code, so those funtions were left unchanged):

Another issue I ran into concurrently was about file inputs. The issue was that file inputs (i.e., shiny::fileInput) was difficult to clear. That is, after a user uploads a file, it was easy to get some of the various parts cleared/cleaned up, but not others:
(Not Easy) The UI components of fileInput (the text of the file name, the loading display) (Not Easy) The data behind the fileInput handler (Easy) Displaying some feedback in the UI after handling file input Load libraries

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I’ve been working on Shiny app at work for the past few months. One of the many frustrating things about Shiny lately has been around buttons. Well, it wasn’t really about buttons, but that’s where it started.
Load libraries
library(shiny) library(bslib) library(crul) Helper function, returned a random UUID from an httpbin server
httpbin_uuid &lt;- function(...) { con &lt;- crul::HttpClient$new(&#34;https://hb.opencpu.org&#34;) res &lt;- con$get(&#34;uuid&#34;) jsonlite::fromJSON(res$parse(&#34;UTF-8&#34;))$uuid } A bslib ui component

As I said this was an inherited repo, and the server side handling for many buttons was done with eventReactive as below. Using eventReactive meant that button clicks only sometimes triggered the server side code.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I recently opened an issue in a repository for a package I’m working on to think about potential footguns and how to avoid them. That word “footguns” got me thinking; does using phrases/metaphors for a certain topic in a way lend credibility to it? For example, we use a lot of sports metaphors in the US, especially baseball (swing for the fences, anything related to bases, curveballs, heavy hitter, etc.), and that says something about the place of baseball in our culture.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>notes to self for next job hunt (some of which may be generally useful):
don’t apply to general tech companies anymore for many reasons. heard back from very very few but that may be b/c I don’t know many people at general tech companies never been able to get through interviews; they’re presumably looking for computer science grads (not me) most of their missions are probably not stuff I’d be happy about at the end of the day. despite missions of doing xyz, it’s probably really about $$ don’t apply to pharma companies any more. there’s lots of good software jobs in that sector, but i’ve struck out 3 times, and so that’s a clear pattern my background/whatever isn’t something they want next time only apply where I have a connection that can refer me or dig around for a referral. it’s super easy to apply for jobs, especially if you don’t write a cover letter; however, the less time I spend surely the less likely I am to hear back make sure (and I’ll probably fail to do it again this time, ugh) to write down what questions I was asked, how I answered, and how to improve on that answer. then study and reference those questions and answers for the next interview its good to have multiple offers at the same time, but then deciding is harder - &amp; I don’t love to negotiating - so maybe don’t worry about multiple offers at the same time next time around I have relatively low expectations in any interview b/c I don’t do technical interviews well - I also try to seek out orgs that do not have crazy technical interview processes - eg., Roche had a whiteboard technical interview that I totally bombed, but was unsurprising in hindsight since the interviewer was an ex-Googler. I’m more of a thinker than a quick responder, making it hard to do well in very fast paced (for me) tech interviews. Though I know i have been a good software engineer where I’ve worked, so these fast paced tech interviews are probably selecting for a certain kind of brain function I guess? seek out orgs with interview processes that have take home assignments - or at least timed coding tests on something like hackerrank - instead of live whiteboard/zoom tech inteviews my last job Deck had a take home test Axiom DS has a take home test approach AdHoc uses a take home test approach Invitae had a hackerrank test, not a take home but better than live coding test cover letters? I still don’t know whether these are worth doing or not. the advice seems to be mixed. they sure take a lot of time, so I hope they’re not necessary for most hiring managers; given my bullet above about spending more time on fewer applications, I could find time for a cover letter on every application if ther’s not that many some data about this last job search:
