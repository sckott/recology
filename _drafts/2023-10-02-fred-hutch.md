Soooo, my last job at [Deck][deck] was amazing. I loved it. I was doing data engineer stuff there, mostly maintaining infrastructure for data pipelines. Everyone was great and the mission was amazing: helping Democrats win. Yet the company was shut down about a month ago, sending me on another job search, the 3rd since early/mid 2021. 

I'm super thrilled to have landed a job (Software and Reproducibility Software Developer) at the [Fred Hutch Data Science Lab (DASL)][dasl], headed up by [Jeff Leek][jeff], working with [Sean Kross][sean], [Amy Paguirigan][amy], and [Monica Gerber][monica], among many other surely amazing folks. 

I'm excited to help support the DASL mission and make software .... bla bla, this paragraph is sounding pretty bad

(What else to say:)
- maybe just that I don't know yet exactly the shape of my work, but am excited to dig in and help support cancer research at Fred Hutch
