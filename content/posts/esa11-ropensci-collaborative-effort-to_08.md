Our [development team](http://ropensci.org/developers/) would like to announce the launch of [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/). As the title states, this project aims to create [R](http://www.r-project.org/) [packages](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) to make open science more available to researchers.

What this means is that we seek to connect researchers using R with as much open data as possible, mainly through APIs. There are a number of R packages that already do this (e.g., [infochimps](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/infochimps/index.html), [twitteR](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html)), but we are making more packages, e.g., for [Mendeley](https://github.com/cboettig/RMendeley), [PLoS Journals](https://github.com/sckott/rplos), and [taxonomic sources](https://github.com/sckott/taxize_) ([ITIS](http://www.itis.gov/), [EOL](http://www.eol.org/), [TNRS](http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/), [Phylomatic](http://www.phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/), [UBio](http://www.ubio.org/)).  
  
Importantly, we are creating a package called [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/), which aims to integrate functions from packages for individual open data sources.  
  
If you are somewhat interested, follow our progress on our [website](http://ropensci.org/), on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/rOpenSci), or [contact us](http://ropensci.org/contact/). If you are really^2 interested you could go to [Github](https://github.com/) and contribute. If  you are really^3 interested, [join our development team](http://ropensci.org/developers/).
