Monday was a good day at ESA in Austin. There were a few topics I promised to report on in my blogging/tweeting.  
  
  
...focused on open source data. [Carly Strasser's](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~strasser/Site/Home.html) presentation on guidelines for data management was awesome (including other talks in the symposium on Creating Effective Data Management Plans for Ecological Research). Although this was a good session, I can't help but wish that they had hammered home the need for open science more. Oh well. Also, they talked a lot about how, and not a lot of why we should properly curate data. Still, a good session. One issue Carly and I talked about was tracking code in versioning systems such as [Github](https://github.com/). There doesn't seem to be a culture of versioning code for analyses/simulations in ecology. But when we get there...it will be easier to share/track/collaborate on  code.  
  
...used R software. [David Jennings](http://eco.confex.com/eco/2011/preliminaryprogram/abstract_31982.htm) talked about a meta-analysis asking if phylogenetic distance influences competition strength in pairwise experiments. David used the metafor package in R to do his meta-analysis. Good form sir.  
  
...did cool science. [Matt Helmus](http://www.ecologicalevolution.org/people/former-lab-members/matthew-helmus/) presented a great talk on phylogenetic species area curves (likely using R, or Matlab maybe?).  
  
  
p.s. [We](http://ropensci.org/developers/) launched [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/2011/07/welcome-to-ropensci/) today.  
  
  
Oddities:  

*   The Tilman effect - Tilman's talk was so packed it looked like there was a line waiting to get into a trendy bar. [Here's a picture](http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~ashander/images/til.jpg) (credit: Jaime Ashander). Bigger room next time anyone? 
*   Wiley came out with an open source journal called [Ecology and Evolution](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2045-7758). This brings them to 3 open source journals (the other two are in other fields). We ([rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/)) will attempt to hand-shake with these journals. 
*   The vegetarian lunch option was surprisingly good. Nice.
