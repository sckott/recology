I started an R package a while back, and a few people have shown interest, so I thought it was time to revist the code. govdat is an interface to various APIs for government data: currently the Sunlight Labs APIs, and the New York Times congress API. Returned objects from functions are simple lists. In future versions of govdat, I may change how data is returned. The following are examples (which is also the package vignette) of using the Sunlight Labs API. I will add examples of using the New York Times Congress API once their site is up again; I'm doing this on 2013-08-28, just after the takedown of their site.

I show just a bit of each data object returned for brevity. And yes, I realize this is not related at all to ecology. 

You will need an API key to use both Sunlight Labs APIs and the New York Times APIs. Get your API key at Sunlight Labs [here](http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/) and NYT [here](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/congress_api). You can pass in your key within each function or you can put the key in your .Rprofile file on your machine (which is read from the default R working directory) and the key will be read in automatically inside the function. I recommend the latter option. 

Do let me know of bugs or feature requests over at the Github issues page [here](https://github.com/sckott/govdat/issues).
