Described in a new Methods in Ecology and Evolution paper [here][], a new [R][] package [RNetLogo][] allows you to use [NetLogo][] from R. 

NetLogo is software is a "multi-agent programmable modeling environment". NetLogo can be used in individual- and agent-based modeling, and is used in the book [_Agent-based and Individual-based Modeling: A Practical Introduction_][book] by Railsback & Grimm. 

I have not tried the package yet, but looks interesting. I am always a fan of running stand-alone programs from R if possible.
