I was in San Francisco last week for an altmetrics conference at PLOS. While there, I visited the [Asian Art Museum](https://www.asianart.org/), just the [Roads of Arabia exhibition](https://www.asianart.org/exhibitions_index/roads-of-arabia).

It was a great exhibit. While I was looking at the pieces, I read many labels, and thought, "hey, what if someone wants this metadata"? 

Since we have an R package in development for scraping museum metadata (called [musemeta](https://github.com/ropensci/musemeta)), I just started some scraping code for this museum. Unfortunately, I don't think the pieces from the Roads of Arabia exhibit are on their site, so no metadata to get. But they do have their main collection searchable online at <https://www.asianart.org/collections/collection>. Examples follow. 

## Installation


```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/musemeta")
```


```r
library("musemeta")
```

## Get metadata for a single object

You have to get the ID for the piece from their website, e.g., `11462` from the url `https://searchcollection.asianart.org/view/objects/asitem/nid/11462`. Once you have an ID you can pass it in ot the `aam()` function.


```r
(out <- aam(11462))
#> <AAM metadata> Molded plaque (tsha tsha)
#>   Object id: 1992.96
#>   Object name: Votive plaque
#>   Date: approx. 1992
#>   Artist: 
#>   Medium: Plaster mixed with resin and pigment
#>   Credit line: Gift of Robert Tevis
#>   On display?: no
#>   Collection: Decorative Arts
#>   Department: Himalayan Art
#>   Dimensions: 
#>   Label: Molded plaques (tsha tshas) are small sacred images, flat or
#>           three-dimensional, shaped out of clay in metal molds. The
#>           images are usually unbaked, and sometimes seeds, paper, or
#>           human ashes were mixed with the clay. Making tsha tshas is
#>           a meritorious act, and monasteries give them away to
#>           pilgrims. Some Tibetans carry tsha tshas inside the amulet
#>           boxes they wear or stuff them into larger images as part of
#>           the consecration of those images. In Bhutan tsha tshas are
#>           found in mani walls (a wall of stones carved with prayers)
#>           or piled up in caves.The practice of making such plaques
#>           began in India, and from there it spread to other countries
#>           in Asia with the introduction of Buddhism. Authentic tsha
#>           tshas are cast from clay. Modern examples , such as those
#>           made for the tourist trade in Tibet, are made of plaster
#>           and cast from ancient (1100-1200) molds and hand colored to
#>           give them the appearance of age.
```

The output is printed for clarity, but you can dig into each element, like 


```r
out$label
#> [1] "Molded plaques (tsha tshas) are small sacred images, flat or three-dimensional, shaped out of clay in metal molds.

## Get metadata for many objects

The `aam()` function is not vectorized, but you can easily get data for many IDs via `lapply` type functions, etc. 


```r

## No search, boo

Note that there is no search functionality yet for this source. Maybe someone can add that via pull requests :)

## Like the others

The others sources in `musemeta` mostly work the same way as the above.
