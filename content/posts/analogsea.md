I think this package name is my best yet. Maybe it doesn't make sense though? At least it did at the time...

Anyway, the main motivation for this package was to be able to automate spinning up Linux boxes to do cloud R/RStudio work. Of course if you are a command line native this is all easy for you, but if you are afraid of the command line and/or just don't want to deal with it, this tool will hopefully help. 

Most of the functions in this package wrap the Digital Ocean API. So you can do things like create a new _droplet_, get information on your droplets, _destroy_ droplets, get information on available images, make snapshots, etc. Basically everything you can do from their website you can do here. Note that all functions are prefixed with `do_` (for Digital Ocean). 

The droplet creation part is what we can leverage to spin up a cloud machine to then install R on, and optionally RStudio server, and even RStudio Shiny server. This allows you to stay within R entirely, not having to go to `ssh` into the Linux machine itself or go to the Digital Ocean website (after initial setup of course). 

If you try this, I recommend using this on R on the command line as you can more easily kill the R session if something goes wrong, and quickly open a new tab/window to `ssh` into the Linux machine if you want.

First, installation


```r
devtools::install_github("sckott/analogsea")
```

Load the library


```r
library("analogsea")
```

Firt, authenticate. This will ask for your Digital Ocean details. You can enter them each R session, or store them in your `.Renviron` file. After successful authentication, each function simply looks for your auth details with `Sys.getenv()`.


```r
do_auth()
```

List available regions


```r
sapply(do_regions()$regions, "[[", "name")
```

Let's create a droplet:


```r
(res <- do_droplets_new(name="foo", size_slug = '512mb', image_slug = 'ubuntu-14-04-x64', region_slug = 'sfo1', ssh_key_ids = 89103))
```

```r
$status
[1] "OK"

$droplet
$droplet$id
[1] 1733336

$droplet$name
[1] "foo"

$droplet$image_id
[1] 3240036

$droplet$size_id
[1] 66

$droplet$event_id
[1] 25278892


attr(,"class")
[1] "dodroplet"
```



List my droplets


```r
do_droplets_get()
```

```
## $status
## [1] "OK"
## 
## $droplets
## $droplets[[1]]
## $droplets[[1]]$id
## [1] 1733336
## 
## $droplets[[1]]$name
## [1] "foo"
## 
## $droplets[[1]]$image_id
## [1] 3240036
## 
## $droplets[[1]]$size_id
## [1] 66
## 
## $droplets[[1]]$region_id
## [1] 3
## 
## $droplets[[1]]$backups_active
## [1] FALSE
## 
## $droplets[[1]]$ip_address
## [1] "107.170.211.252"
## 
## $droplets[[1]]$private_ip_address
## NULL
## 
## $droplets[[1]]$locked
## [1] FALSE
## 
## $droplets[[1]]$status
## [1] "active"
## 
## $droplets[[1]]$created_at
## [1] "2014-05-28T05:59:22Z"
```

Cool, we have a new Linux box with 512 mb RAM, running Ubuntu 14.04 in the SF region. Notice that I'm using my SSH key here. If you don't use your SSH key, Digital Ocean will email you a password, which you then use. We just have to wait a bit (sometimes 20 seconds, sometimes a few minutes) for it to spin up.

Now we can install stuff. Here, I'll install R, and RStudio Server. This step prints out the progress as you would see if you did `ssh` into the box itself outside of R. The RStudio Server instance will pop up in your default browser when this operation is done. 


```r
do_install(res$droplet$id, what='rstudio', usr='hey', pwd='there')
```

You can install some things like the `libcurl` and `libxml` libraries too with the `deps` parameter.

When you're done, you can destroy your droplet from R too


```r
do_droplets_destroy(res$droplet$id)
```

```
## $status
## [1] "OK"
## 
## $event_id
## [1] 25279124
```

Let me know if you have any thoughts :)
