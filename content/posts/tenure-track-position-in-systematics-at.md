There is an awesome position opening up for an assistant professor in systematics at the University of Vermont. Below is the announcement, and see the [original post](http://currentecology.blogspot.com/2011/08/tenure-track-position-in-systematics-at.html) at the [Distributed Ecology blog](http://currentecology.blogspot.com/). Why is this related to R? One can do a lot of systematics work in R, including retrieving scientific collections data through an upcoming package handshaking with [VertNet](http://vertnet.org/index.php) (part of the [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/) project), managing large data sets, retrieval of GenBank data through the ape package (see fxn read.genbank), phylogenetic reconstruction and analysis, and more. So I am sure a systematist with R ninja skills will surely have a head up on the rest of the field.
