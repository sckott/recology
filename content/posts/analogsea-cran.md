`analogsea` is now on CRAN. We started developing the pkg back in [May 2014][firstcomm], but just 
now getting the first version on CRAN. It's a collaboration with [Hadley][hadley] and [Winston Chang][chang].

Most of `analogsea` package is for interacting with the [Digital Ocean API](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/), including:

* Manage domains
* Manage ssh keys
* Get actions
* Manage images
* Manage droplets (servers)

A number of convenience functions are included for doing tasks (e.g., resizing 
a droplet) that aren't supported by Digital Ocean's API out of the box (i.e., 
there's no API route for it). 

In addition to wrapping their API routes, we provide other functionality, e.g.: 

* execute shell commands on a droplet (server)
* execute R commands on a droplet
* install R
* install RStudio server
* install Shiny server

Other functionality we're working on, not yet available:

* install OpenCPU
* use `packrat` to move projects from local to server, and vice versa

## Install

Binaries are not yet on CRAN, but you can install from source.


```r
# install.packages("analogsea") # when binaries available
install.packages("analogsea", repos = "https://cran.r-project.org", type = "source")
```

Or install development version from GitHub


```r
devtools::install_github("sckott/analogsea")
```

Load `analogsea`


```r
library("analogsea")
```

## Etc.

As this post is mostly to announce that this pkg is on CRAN now, I won't go through examples, but instead point you to the package [README][readme] and [vignette][vign] in which we cover 
creating a Digital Ocean account, authenticating, and have many examples.

Let us know what you think. We'd love to hear about any problems, use cases, feature requests.
