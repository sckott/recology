[Carl Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info/), a graduate student at UC Davis, just got two packages on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html).  One is [treebase](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/treebase/index.html), which which handshakes with the [Treebase](http://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html) API.  The other is [rfishbase](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rfishbase/index.html), which connects with the [Fishbase](http://www.fishbase.org/search.php), although I believe just scrapes XML content as there is no API.  See development on GitHub for treebase [here](https://github.com/ropensci/treeBASE), and for rfishbase [here](https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase).  Carl has some tutorials on treebase and rfishbase at his website [here](http://www.carlboettiger.info/), and we have an official rOpenSci tutorial for treebase [here](http://ropensci.org/tutorials/r-treebase-tutorial/).  
  
Basically, these two R packages let you search and pull down data from Treebase and Fishbase - pretty awesome.  This improves workflow, and puts your data search and acquisition component into your code, instead of being a bunch of mouse clicks in a browser.  
  
These two packages are part of the [rOpenSci project](http://ropensci.org/).
