FigShare - I very much like this idea of a place to put your data online that is NOT published. Dryad is a nice place for datastes linked with published papers, but there isn't really a place for datasets that perhaps did not make the cut for a published paper, and if known to the scientific community, could potentially help resolve the "file-drawer" effect in meta-analyses. (wow, run on sentence)
