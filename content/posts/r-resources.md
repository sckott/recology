I'm doing a presentation today to grad students on R resources. I have been writing HTML presentations recently, but some great tools are now available to convert text that is easy to read and write to presentations. 

+ RStudio has something called `R presentations`, that is basically Markdown. This tool is built in to RStudio. See some docs [here](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/presentations/overview). A cool feature of RStudio's presentations is that the preview of the presentation live updates on each save - nice <i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i>
+ Another option is the slidify package, made by [Ramnath Vaidyanathan](https://github.com/ramnathv). The canonical url for slidify is [here](http://slidify.org/). Slidify gives you more options and flexibity than RStudio presentations. 

For this presentation I went with RStudio's product. See the Markdown file for the presentation [here](https://github.com/sckott/posterstalks/blob/gh-pages/sfu/resources/r_resources.Rpres). 

Check out the presentation slides here, and if you want, fork it on Github, change it, submit changes back to me, etc. (click to go to slides)
