I will be blogging about the upcoming Ecological Society of America meeting in Austin, TX. I will focus on discussing talks/posters that:  
  
1.  Have taken a cool approach to using data, or
2.  Have focused on open science/data, or
3.  Done something cool with R software, or
4.  Are just exciting in general

I will also tweet throughout the meeting from @recology\_ (yes the underscore is part of the name, recology was already taken). 

The hashtag for the meeting this year is #ESA11
