There are a lot of ways to make R packages. Many blog posts have covered making
R packages, but for the most part they've covered only how they make
packages, going from the required files for a package, what to put in DESCRIPTION, etc. But what about the tooling? I'm not going to talk about the code, etc. - but rather the different ways to approach it.

The blog posts/etc. on making R packages:

* [Writing an R package from scratch](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) - Hilary Parker
* [Developing R packages](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages) - Jeff Leek
* [stat545 - Write your own R package](http://stat545.com/packages00_index.html) - Jenny Bryan's statistics 545 class at UBC
* [R package primer](http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/) - Karl Boman
* [Making Your First R Package](http://tinyheero.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/07/26/making-your-first-R-package.html) - Fong Chun Chan
* [R Package Development Pictorial](http://www.mjdenny.com/R_Package_Pictorial.html) - Matthew Denny
* [Coursera course on building R packages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-packages)
* [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) by Hadley for a full treatment of the subject.
* From time to time you may need to reference CRAN's [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html).


## the ways

The following are not mutually exclusive - some can be combined with others.

In process of writing this I figured I should ask other people what they do. I ended up asking 16 people - not a random selection or a big enough `n` to really say anything conclusively. But it did allow me to cover more ways of doing
package dev.


### mason

github: <https://github.com/metacran/mason> (by Gábor Csárdi)

> Note that `mason` is on CRAN, but it's a completely different package.

You can use `mason` inside of R or via `Rscript` on the cli.

```r
devtools::install_github("metacran/mason")
library(mason)
mason::mason()
```

Then you'll go through a series of prompts asking you for inormation (package name, license, your name, etc.)

Out of 16 people I talked to, 2 mentioned using `mason`.


### devtools

github: <https://github.com/hadley/devtools> (by Hadley Wickham)

Within R:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::create("foobar")
```

On the cli, we can do:

```r
Rscript -e 'devtools::create("foobar")'
```

`devtools::create()` adds basic set of files needed for an R package - and also adds files assuming you use the RStudio IDE. Though you can not add RStudio files by choosing `rstudio = FALSE`.

Be aware of the default entry in the `NAMESPACE` file: `exportPattern("^[^\\.]")`. The first time you generate documentation, e.g., via `devtools::document()` your `NAMESPACE` file will be changed to only export those things you want exported, which is ideal.

Out of 16 people I talked to, 7 mentioned using `devtools`.


### rcmdcheck

rcmdcheck: <https://github.com/r-lib/rcmdcheck>

This is an alternative to running `R CMD CHECK` or `devtools::check()`, that gives nice colorized output, at least in the terminal.

I usually run it like this in the root of an R package directory in my terminal (running with `--as-cran` to check as CRAN does, and `--run-dontrun` to run examples wrapped in `\dontrun{}`):

```
Rscript -e 'rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(args = c("--as-cran", "--run-dontrun"))'
```


### IDE: RStudio

rstudio: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop>

The following is a guide provided by RStudio for creating packages in RStudio IDE: [Using RStudio for package development](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486488-Developing-Packages-with-RStudio)

When in RStudio - New Project in upper left hand corner - choose new or existing directory - choose R package - name the package, and you probably want to initialize git by checking the appropriate box.

Out of 16 people I talked to, 14 used RStudio all the time or most of the time.
It's popular, to say the least.

A noteable quote from one person I talked to:

> all rstudio all day

#### RStudio inside of Docker

rstudio server: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/>
rstudio server docker container: <https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio/>

I know of at least one person that works this way, and surely there are others.

As simple as:

```sh
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 rocker/rstudio
```

Then visit `localhost:8787` in your browser.


### web

For example, we could just create files from the Github website. e.g,.

- New Repository
- then add files you'd need for an R package and edit those in the browser

Out of 16 people I talked to, 2 mentioned starting with creating a GitHub repository, then pulling that down, R development, etc. etc., then push back up. But no one mentioned all in browser - although see **phone dev** below.

The Github web interface is an important starting point for getting people into code in general when they are not familiar with git.


### text editor

If you primarily work in a text editor perhaps this (using [Atom editor](https://atom.io/)):

`Rscript -e 'devtools::create("foobar")' && cd foobar && git init && atom .`

![atom](/2017-06-18-package-dev/atom.png)

Or the same for [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) with `subl .` instead of `atom .`

Two of 16 people I talked to mentioned using [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) exclusively or mostly. One of the 16 people mentione Sublime Text by name - that's also the editor I use (I often have RStudio and Sublime Text open for the same R package - switching between them for the features I like).


### copy/paste

Sometimes when creating a new package I know of a previous package I've created that may have similar code I want in the new one or so. So I just copy/paste essentially the old package into a new folder. Be careful when doing this: make sure to delete git history, then re-initialize git (`rm -rf .git && git init` in the new repository). Ideally you use roxygen/devtools for docs - in which case just delete all files in `man/` then when you generate docs, you get all new man files.


### rhub

rhub: <https://builder.r-hub.io/> <https://github.com/r-hub> <https://www.r-consortium.org/events/2016/10/11/r-hub-public-beta>

R-hub is a project by Gabor Csárdi, funded by the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/), which is a service for developing, building, testing and validating R packages.

One of the 16 people I talked to mentioned `rhub` - but I imagine many of them use it. I use it :)

I usually use it from the command line (or you can use it from within R, either on CLI or RStudio), like `rhub::check_for_cran()` to get checks for my package on Windows and two Linux platforms, before sending to CRAN.


### the Makefile

The [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) is a file containing a set of directives. Some use a Makefile for a few or even most things one does in package development, from re-making `man` files, to building, installing, checking, building vignettes, making [pkgdown docs](https://github.com/hadley/pkgdown), and more. Makefiles can include actions that do not just R things, but run other programming/command line tools. It's a good idea when contributing to another R package to look for a Makefile - and to use them in your own package development. I don't personally use them enough, and ideally will use them more in the future.

Here's an example of [a Makefile](https://github.com/richfitz/storr/blob/master/Makefile) from Rich FitzJohn:

<a href="https://github.com/richfitz/storr/blob/master/Makefile"><img src="/2017-06-18-package-dev/makefile.png" width="400"></a>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

### ruby?

To scratch a personal itch, I made a little Ruby gem with a command line tool to run one or more specific tests by fuzzy matching the name of the test file. Reason is, sometimes I work on a test file and I just want to run that test and not any others - and not from within RStudio, but form the terminal.

<https://github.com/sckott/rubrb>

```sh
➜ rb test config
using:
  tests/testthat/test-config-fxns.R

config fxns: ........

DONE ===========================================================================
```

I'm sure there's lots of these types of things out there - scratching an itch that helps the person work the way they want to work.

While we're on the topic of Ruby, Travis-CI has a nice Ruby gem [travis](https://rubygems.org/gems/travis) to interact with Travis for your R packages. There's also one for [Circle-CI](https://rubygems.org/gems/circle-cli) and [I've written one for Appveyor](https://rubygems.org/gems/veyor).


### phone dev

### putting stuff on the web

While we're talking about tooling, I thought I should briefly mention putting code up on the interwebs. There's many code hosting options - for brevity, we'll just cover GitHub.

It's a good idea to learn command line git, and related command line tools that make using git easier - if you can get work done faster you have more time to look at cat pictures!

[hub](https://github.com/github/hub) is one git tool that I use a lot. For example, create a folder, initialize a git repo, push to github, then open the just created repo on Github:

`mkdir helloworld && cd helloworld && hub init && hub create sckott/helloworld && hub browse`

where `hub create` uses the `owner/repo` pattern
