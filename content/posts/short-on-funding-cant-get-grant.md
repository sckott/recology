Crowdsourced funding is becoming a sustainable way for various artists, entrepreneurs, etc. to get their idea funded from individuals. For example, think of [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) and [RocketHub](http://www.rockethub.com/).  
  
  
Jai Ranganathan and Jarrett Byrnes have started an experiment to determine how well crowdfunding can work for scientists: The SciFund Challenge. Go here to [signup](http://scifund.wordpress.com/sign-up/) and here for their [website](http://scifund.wordpress.com/).  
  
  
The deadline to sign up is Oct. 1
