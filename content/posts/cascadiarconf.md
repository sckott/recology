## Agenda

No details yet - but likely to be a series of workshops as well as single track set of talks.

We'll be accepting talk submissions soonish.

## Tickets

We aren't out to make money - tickets will be cheap and probably free for students.

## Why

Why not!?  But srsly, there's not that many R conferences, so more is better at this point. In addition, there is an increasingly large R community in Portland at least judged by the ~1,140 members in the [Portland R Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/) - so a conference makes sense. In addition, this will be an excuse to hopefully get together people from other nearby cities: Corvallis, Salem, Seattle, etc.
