I"€	<p>Monday was a good day at ESA in Austin.Â There were a few topics I promised to report on in my blogging/tweeting.<br /><br /><br />â€¦focused on open source data. <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~strasser/Site/Home.html">Carly Strasserâ€™s</a> presentation on guidelines for data management was awesome (including other talks in the symposium on Creating Effective Data Management Plans for Ecological Research). Although this was a good session, I canâ€™tÂ help but wish that they had hammered home the need for open science more. Oh well. Also, they talkedÂ a lot about how, and not a lot of why we should properly curate data. Still, a good session. One issue Carly and I talked about was tracking code in versioning systems such as <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. There doesnâ€™t seem to be a culture of versioning code for analyses/simulations in ecology. But when we get thereâ€¦it will be easier to share/track/collaborate on Â code.<br /><br />â€¦used R software. <a href="http://eco.confex.com/eco/2011/preliminaryprogram/abstract_31982.htm">David Jennings</a>Â talked about a meta-analysis asking if phylogenetic distance influences competition strength in pairwise experiments. David used the metafor package in R to do his meta-analysis. Good form sir.<br /><br />â€¦did cool science. <a href="http://www.ecologicalevolution.org/people/former-lab-members/matthew-helmus/">Matt Helmus </a>presented a great talk on phylogenetic species area curves (likely using R, or Matlab maybe?).<br /><br /><br />p.s. <a href="http://ropensci.org/developers/">We</a> launched <a href="http://ropensci.org/2011/07/welcome-to-ropensci/">rOpenSci</a> today.<br /><br /><br />Oddities:<br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Tilman effect - Tilmanâ€™s talk was so packed it looked like there was a line waiting to get into a trendy bar. <a href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~ashander/images/til.jpg">Hereâ€™s a picture</a>Â (credit: Jaime Ashander). Bigger room next time anyone?Â &lt;/li&gt;</p>
<li>Wiley came out with an open source journal called <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2045-7758">Ecology and Evolution</a>. This brings them to 3 open source journals (the other two are in other fields). We (<a href="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a>) will attempt to hand-shake with these journals.&nbsp; </li>
<li>The vegetarian lunch option was surprisingly good. Nice.&nbsp;</li>
<p>&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
