I"©.<p>I was in San Francisco last week for an altmetrics conference at PLOS. While there, I visited the <a href="http://www.asianart.org/">Asian Art Museum</a>, just the <a href="http://www.asianart.org/exhibitions_index/roads-of-arabia">Roads of Arabia exhibition</a>.</p>

<p>It was a great exhibit. While I was looking at the pieces, I read many labels, and thought, â€œhey, what if someone wants this metadataâ€?</p>

<p>Since we have an R package in development for scraping museum metadata (called <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/musemeta">musemeta</a>), I just started some scraping code for this museum. Unfortunately, I donâ€™t think the pieces from the Roads of Arabia exhibit are on their site, so no metadata to get. But they do have their main collection searchable online at <a href="http://www.asianart.org/collections/collection">http://www.asianart.org/collections/collection</a>. Examples follow.</p>

<p>You have to get the ID for the piece from their website, e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">11462</code> from the url <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://searchcollection.asianart.org/view/objects/asitem/nid/11462</code>. Once you have an ID you can pass it in ot the <code class="highlighter-rouge">aam()</code> function.</p>
