I"<p>I was listening to a Bike Shed podcast <a href="http://bikeshed.fm/189">episode 189, â€œItâ€™s Gonna Work, Definitely, No Problems Whatsoeverâ€</a>, and starting at 27:44 there was a conversation about exception handling. Specifically it was about exception handling in control flow when doing web API requests. This topic piqued my interest straight away as I do a lot of API stuff (making and wrapping).</p>
