After [my presentation yesterday][last] to a group of grad students on R resources, I did a presentation today on intro to R data manipulation, visualizations, and analyses/visualizations of biparite networks and community level analyses (diversity, rarefaction, ordination, etc.). As I said [yesterday][last] I've been playing with two ways to make reproducible presentations in R: [RStudio's presentations][rstudio] built in to RStudio IDE, and [Slidify][slidify]. Yesterday I went with RStudio's product - today I used Slidify. See the Markdown file for the presentation [here](https://github.com/sckott/posterstalks/blob/gh-pages/sfu/resources/r_resources.Rpres). 

Check out the presentation slides [here](https://bitly.com/sfuworkshop), and if you want, fork [the code on Github](http://bit.ly/1bKVX2O), change it, submit changes back to me, etc. (click on the image to go to slides)

How I actually ran the 2 hr workshop was to present a few slides, then live demo writing the code out with students following along, with a number of times where they do something on their own.
